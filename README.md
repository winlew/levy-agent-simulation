# Lévy Agent Simulation

## Objective
This project investigates the random walks generated by autonomous agents that are controlled by a neural reservoir.
Specifically, the step length distributions of the agent trajectories are analysed to determine whether they follow a power-law, which would render the agents to exhibit Lévy walks.

## Set Up
Clone the repository

```git clone git@github.com:winlew/levy-agent-simulation.git```

Create a virtual environment 

```python3 -m venv levy-agent-simulation```\
```source levy-agent-simulation/bin/activate```

Install the required packages

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Configure a simulation in parameters.json. Then start it by executing main.py.
It will prompt you in the terminal to specify the location on where to store the results inside the data folder.
